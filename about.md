I'm a musician who learned to build apps.  
In March 2017 my wife and I moved from the conservative banking city  
of Charlotte, North Carolina to Austin, Texas.  
The capitol city is home to us now, and it is a perfect fit.  
We both love trying new food, and we love the art and music scene.  
My wife is a trained artist, and we are blessed to live in such a beautiful city.  
Austin is a tech and startup hub, so you may see me out at tech meetups.  
When we're not in the city, we're hiking trails and swimming in local water holes.
