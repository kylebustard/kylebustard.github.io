## DevOps solutions for business  
Altostratus LLC was formed in late March 2018, and will launch DevOps consultant services in April 2018.  

I use cloud services like AWS to provide inexpensive solutions for your business.  
With the cheap cost of cloud computing today, it is no longer an option
to invest in a qualified DevOps engineer who can free up your entire software development team
so that they can be more productive.
I will be certified AWS associate in the future, and would love to share my expertise with your team!

## Web application development for business  
I use the hottest technologies like Facebook's React JavaScript library and Google's Golang all-purpose programming language.  

Additionally, I have experience with older technologies. 
Take a look inside an enterprise time-tracking app I built with Ruby on Rails:

## Stay tuned 
Education DevOps blogs and details of services provided will be coming
to altostratus.tv in the future!
